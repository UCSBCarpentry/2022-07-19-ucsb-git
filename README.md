# The Carpentries Workshop: Repo Progress

3. Once you are done, please also [let us know][email] the workshop URL. If this is a self-organised
   workshop, you should also [fill in the self-organized workshop
   form][self-organized-workshop-form] (if you have not already done so), so we can keep track of
   all workshops. We build the list of workshops on our websites from the data included in your
   `index.md` page. We can only do that if you [customize][customization] that page correctly *and*
   let us know the workshop URL.

5. Edit the `schedule.html` file to edit the schedule for your upcoming workshop. This file is
   located in the `_includes` directory, make sure to choose the one from the appropriate `dc` (Data
   Carpentry workshop), `lc` (Library Carpentry), or `swc` (Software Carpentry) subdirectory.

### Update the content of the README file

You can change the `README.md` file in your website's repository, which contains these instructions,
so that it contains a short description of your workshop and a link to the workshop website.


## Additional Notes

**Note:**
please do all of your work in your repository's `gh-pages` branch,
since [GitHub automatically publishes that as a website][github-project-pages].

**Note:**
this template includes some files and directories that most workshops do not need,
but which provide a standard place to put extra content if desired.
See the [design notes][design] for more information about these.

Further instructions are available in [the customization instructions][customization].
This [FAQ][faq] includes a few extra tips (additions are always welcome)
and these notes on [the background and design][design] of this template may help as well.


## Creating Extra Pages

In rare cases,
you may want to add extra pages to your workshop website.
You can do this by putting either Markdown or HTML pages in the website's root directory
and styling them according to the instructions give in
[the lesson template][lesson-example].


## Installing Software

If you want to set up Jekyll so that you can preview changes on your own machine before pushing them
to GitHub, you must install the software described in the lesson example [setup
instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html#jekyll-setup-for-lesson-development).

## Setting Up a Separate Repository for Learners

If you are teaching Git,
you should create a separate repository for learners to use in that lesson.
You should not have them use the workshop website repository because:

* your workshop website repository contains many files that most learners don't need to see during
  the lesson, and

* you probably don't want to accidentally merge a damaging pull request from a novice Git user into
  your workshop's website while you are using it to teach.

You can call this repository whatever you like, and add whatever content you need to it.

## Getting and Giving Help

We are committed to offering a pleasant setup experience for our learners and organizers.
If you find bugs in our instructions,
or would like to suggest improvements,
please [file an issue][issues]
or [mail us][email].
